This SPA(Single Page Application) was designed to mimic a COVID-19 clinical trial randomization system where a patient is randomly assigned to the Trial Vaccine or to Placebo, and then given a patient ID number. (They can only see Treatment A or Treatment B, so they wonâ€™t know which one they have to prevent bias). On the page it can be shown how many people are assigned to Treatment A and how many are assigned to Treatment B. One can also pull up a list of all patients and see the encrypted identifiers of the patients. They can also delete that patient if they no longer want to participate or if they cannot be located.
